# Developer Kickstart Week 5: Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL)

This project is part of the Developer Kickstart Week 5 curriculum at Cloud Code Academy. It's crafted to assist beginner Salesforce developers to learn and exercise Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL), a pivotal aspect of the Apex programming language.

## Goals of the Practice

In the course  of this practice project, you'll build essential knowledge about:
- Understanding the fundamentals of SOQL and its significance in Apex and Salesforce development.
- Crafting basic SOQL queries using the SELECT statement to retrieve data from Salesforce objects.
- Employing WHERE clause filters in SOQL queries to refine the data retrieved based on specific conditions.
- Navigating relationship queries in SOQL to retrieve data from related Salesforce objects.
- Using the LIMIT keyword in SOQL queries to regulate the number of records retrieved.

By mastering SOQL, you will boost your ability to interact with Salesforce data programmatically, enabling you to build dynamic, data-driven applications on the Salesforce platform. These concepts lay the foundation for advanced data manipulation and handling techniques in Salesforce.

To get started, you'll need a Salesforce Trailhead Playground. If you don't have one, you can create it for free from any Trailhead module.

After you've set up your Trailhead Playground:

1. Install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Install Salesforce Extension Pack in Visual Studio Code. This can be done by searching 'Salesforce Extension Pack' in the Extensions view in VS Code and clicking Install.
3. Authorize your Trailhead Playground in Visual Studio Code. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the command palette and type 'SFDX: Authorize an Org', then press Enter. Follow the steps in the browser to log in to your Playground, then return to VS Code.
4. Deploy the Apex Class by right clicking on the `VariablesDatatypesOperators` and  `VariablesDatatypesOperatorsTest` file a using the option SFDX: Deploy Source to Org.

## Running the Test Classes

To run the test classes:

1. Open the command palette with `Ctrl + Shift + P`.
2. Type 'SFDX: Invoke Apex Tests...', and press Enter.
3. In the 'Select Test Class' input, select the test class you want to run and press Enter.
4. The test results will appear in the Output panel at the bottom of the screen. You can switch to the 'Test' tab in this panel to see a summary of the test run.
